## In this Programming Assignment will take advantage of 
## the scoping rules of the R language and how 
## they can be manipulated to preserve state inside of an R object.

## The first function, makeVector creates a special 
##"vector", which is really a list containing a function to

## 1. set the value of the vector
## 2. get the value of the vector
## 3. set the value of the mean
## 4. get the value of the mean


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  m <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    m <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setinverse <- function(inverse) m <<- solve
  getinverse <- function() m
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setinverse = setinverse,
       getinverse = getinverse)
}


## Write a short comment describing this function
## The following function calculates the mean of the special "vector" 
## created with the above function. However, it first checks to see 
## if the mean has already been calculated. 
## If so, it gets the mean from the cache and skips the computation. 
## Otherwise, it calculates the mean of the data and sets 
## the value of the mean in the cache via the setmean function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  m <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(m)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(m)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  m <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(m)
  m
}
